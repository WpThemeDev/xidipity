CSS files are aggragated by function and are loaded from the
"functions.php" file to improve performance. Exceptions to this
rule include files imported within "editor-style.css" and
fonts imported within the "blog-var.css" file. The "blog-common.css"
file contains CSS classes shared by the editor and the web. The "min"
file versions are compressed for speed using the program cssminifier
("https://cssminifier.com/").
